# Shape-Smack
A matching game I developed using C++ in Visual Studios

SHAPE SMACK

use the arrow keys to move. Gain points for matching your shape to the correct bouncing shape. Lose points for the wrong match. The better you match the bigger you get, but don't get too many wrong, if you get small enough it's game over.

To run:
unzip the zip file. Then, go into the Debug folder. Inside there, launch 'Game DirectX Framework.exe' to run the game
